# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Objective 
Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthqukes all over the world.  The earthquake is presented on the map by a circle and color.  The color and diameter of the circle are dependent on the magnitude of the earthquake.  A higher magnitude will show a cicle with a bigger diameter and darker color.  Additionally, a pop up marker will display the magnitude and location of the earthquake.

My final map visualization will show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.  Additionally, showing all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map and add a third map.

### Module Tasks
- Use JS and D3 to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from GeoJSON data.
- Use Leaflet to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
- Create interactivity for the earthquake data.

### Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
